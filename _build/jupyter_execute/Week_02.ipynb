I recommend the section on [Data collection](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/00-Data-Collection.html) from Melanie Walsh's course \"Introduction to Data Analytics and Python\".

    "\n",
    "We will be using a module called `requests` to do this. [Modules](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/) or libraries are collections of functions and utilities already built in python. To use them, you first have to import them. It's good practice to import all the modules at the beginning of your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "`requests` has a function `get()` that goes and grabs the page. Let's say we want to get the script for the movie [Ghostbusters](http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/Ghostbusters.txt). Go to the Scifiscripts webpage and check what's there. We are going to use the url to get the text of the page. \n",

    "If you look at that variable, you'll see that it has lots of code like `\\r` and `\\n`. But you can also get it to print like a web page with `print()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will save that file to use later. You should have a directory called `data/` where this notebook is. Then simply give python the path to that directory and put the file there.

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun shines brightly on the classic facade of the main library at Fifth\\r\\nAvenue and 42nd Street.  In the adjacent park area, pretty hustlers and\\r\\ndrug peddlers go about their business.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRONT STEPS\\r\\n\\r\\nA few people lounge on the steps flanked by the familiar stone lions.\\r\\n\\r\\nINT. MAIN READING ROOM -- DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople are dotted throughout the room sitting at the long oak tables\\r\\npolished by decades of use.  Reading lamps with green glass shades cast a\\r\\ngolden glow on the tables.  The patina of age is everywhere.  It is very\\r\\nquiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nLIBRARIAN\\r\\n\\r\\nA slightly stout, studious looking girl in her late twenties circulates\\r\\nquietly among the tables picking up books and putting them on her cart.\\r\\nEverything seems completely normal and peaceful.\\r\\n\\r\\nPOV\\r\\n\\r\\nA single eerie musical note signals the presence of something strange\\r\\nlooking down on the Librarian from a vantage point high above the room.\\r\\nIt follows the Librarian as she pushes her cart around the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nINT. WORK AREA\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Librarian is alone in a back room sorting books for reshelving.\\r\\nBehind her is the card catalogue.  One of the books attracts her interest\\r\\nand she starts leafing through it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CARD CATALOGUE\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother eerie note is heard as one of the drawers silently slides open\\r\\nbehind the Librarian and hundreds of index cards start popping out.  The\\r\\nLibrarian continues reading completely oblivious to this strange\\r\\nphenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gets up and moves past another row of cabinets.  Two more drawers\\r\\nquietly slide open, and thousands of file cards start shooting out of the\\r\\nopen drawers just behind her, but the Librarian still doesn\\'t notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STACKS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Librarian works her way through rows and rows of old iron shelves\\r\\ncontaining many thousands of volumes stacked from floor to ceiling.  As\\r\\nshe puts the books back in their proper places, she slowly gets the\\r\\nfeeling that she\\'s being watched.  She continues her task but suddenly\\r\\nhears a scratching noise and stops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLIBRARIAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(puzzled)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tHello?  Is anybody there?\\r\\n\\r\\nA ROW OF BOOKS\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Librarian walks down the aisle, books start shooting off the shelf\\r\\nbehind her.  She turns suddenly and sees the fallen books.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LIBRARIAN\\r\\n\\r\\nFrightened now, she walks slowly to the end of the aisle and tentatively\\r\\npeeks around the corner.  Seeing no one, she starts to scratch her head\\r\\nand suddenly a dozen books fly off the shelf right in front of her and\\r\\nfall to the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLIBRARIAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(frightened)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAll right!  Who\\'s there?  Lyle? Is that you?\\r\\n\\r\\nVery slowly now, her heart pounding, the Librarian tiptoes to the other\\r\\nend of the aisle.  She gets to the corner and starts to peek around it,\\r\\nafraid to look but unable to resist.\\r\\n\\r\\nINT. THE NEXT AISLE -- DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Librarian comes slowly around the end of the stacks and gets her first\\r\\nlook at the thing that\\'s been watching her.  Her eyes go very wide and her\\r\\nmouth opens in horror. She screams.\\r\\n\\r\\nEXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents are entering and leaving a neo-Gothic building on the\\r\\nUniversity\\'s upper west side campus.  A sign identifies the building as:\\r\\nWeaver Hall -- Department of Psychology.\\r\\n\\r\\nINT. BASEMENT -- WEAVER HALL -- DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one end of the dingy corridor is a door marked PARANORMAL STUDIES\\r\\nLABORATORY.  A sign dangles from the doorknob: Maid -- Please Make Up This\\r\\nRoom.  Scrawled across the door is a line of student graffiti that reads:\\r\\n\"Venkman Burn In Hell!\"  It looks like it\\'s been written in blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN (V.O.)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tNow I\\'m going to turn over the next card and\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tI want you to concentrate and tell me what\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tyou think it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nINT. PARANORMAL STUDIES LAB -- SAME TIME - DAY\\r\\n\\r\\nDR. PETER VENKMAN is administering an ESP test to two student volunteers,\\r\\na boy and a girl, who sit across the table from him separated from each\\r\\nother by a screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenkman is an associate professor but his rumpled suit and the manic gleam\\r\\nin his eyes indicate an underlying instability in his nature.  However,\\r\\nwhile a little short on academic credentials, Venkman is long on\\r\\nconfidence, charm and salesmanship.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turns to the male volunteer, an obnoxious SOPHOMORE, and pulls out a\\r\\ncard from the standard deck of ESP symbols.  The card is visible to the\\r\\ncamera over Venkman\\'s shoulder but hidden from the sophomore by a masonite\\r\\nboard that rests between them on the table.  The card shows a star symbol\\r\\non it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAll right.  What is it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSOPHOMORE\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(concentrates)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tA square?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(shakes his head)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tGood guess -- but no.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shows the Sophomore the star card then presses a button on the table\\r\\nwhich administers a mild electric shock to the volunteer.  The Sophomore\\r\\ntwitches involuntarily as the shock passes through the electrode attached\\r\\nto his fingertips.  Then Venkman turns to the female volunteer, a very\\r\\nbeautiful COED.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tNow just clear your mind and tell me what\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tyou see.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turns over a card with a circle on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCOED\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(thinks hard)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tIs it a star?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(feigning surprise)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is a star!  That\\'s great.  You\\'re very\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tgood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coed beams proudly as Venkman turns back to the Sophomore without\\r\\nshowing her the card.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(to the Sophomore)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tNow think.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turns up the diamond card.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sophomore glances nervously at the electrodes, then ventures a guess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSOPHOMORE\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tCircle?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tClose -- but definitely wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shocks him again and swivels around to face the Coed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN (CONT\\'D)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tReady?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(she nods and he turns up\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe triangle card)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCOED\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(biting her lip)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tUmmm -- figure eight?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(lies)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tIncredible!  Five for five.  You\\'re not\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tcheating on me here, are you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCOED\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(amazed at her own ability)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tNo.  They\\'re just coming to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tWell, you\\'re doing great.  Keep it up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turns back to the Sophomore who winces as the next card is turned\\r\\nup -- two parallel wavy lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN (CONT\\'D)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tNervous?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSOPHOMORE\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tYes.  I don\\'t like this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tWell, just 75 more to go.  What\\'s this one?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSOPHOMORE\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(takes a deep breath)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tTwo wavy lines?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(burying the card)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tSorry.

I\\'m getting a little tired of this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tYou volunteered, didn\\'t you?  Aren\\'t we\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tpaying you for this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSOPHOMORE\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tYeah, but I didn\\'t know you were going to\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tgive me electric shocks.  What are you\\r\\n\\t\\t\\ttrying to prove?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tI\\'m studying the effect of negative\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treinforcement on ESP ability.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSOPHOMORE\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tI\\'ll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThen my theory was correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sophomore gets up, pulls the electrodes off his fingertips and exits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSOPHOMORE\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(as he goes)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tKeep the five bucks.  I\\'ve had it!\\r\\n\\r\\nVenkman turns back to the Coed and shrugs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tWell, I guess some people have it and some\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tdon\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCOED\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(provocatively)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tDo you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tDefinitely.

THEATER\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is packed with hooting, jeering, beer-drinking potsmoking\\r\\ndowntowners, all wearing cardboard 3-D glasses. They are wildly razzing\\r\\nand throwing things at the screen on which is running a bad sixties\\r\\nBritish horror indie pic.  The film breaks. The sound crackles off and the\\r\\nlights come on. There is a storm of protest and abuse hurled at the\\r\\nprojectionist.  Then from all around them there starts a thin whistling\\r\\nwhine.  It builds above the shouts and jeers in the theater until everyone\\r\\nstops to hear what it is. It is like no other sound ever heard -- a\\r\\npiercing, all-permeating shrill whistle like the fan blades of some\\r\\nmassive unseen turbine beginning to rotate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights in the theater flicker. The musty ancient curtains on either\\r\\nside of the screen are picked up in an unseen wind which lifts them,\\r\\nspreading dust and ripped old fabric about the house.  There are shouts\\r\\nand sounds and noises from deep beyond the recesses of the backstage.  The\\r\\ncurtains are now flying in a serious wind.  All the lights in the theater\\r\\ngo out except that from the projection booth.  From a point in the center\\r\\nof the screen, a searing bolt of phosphorescent light rips back along the\\r\\nprojection beam into the booth.  The beam evolves into an etheric strand\\r\\nof unified glistening particles.  The wind dies down.  People in the house\\r\\nare hushed.  They gaze transfixed as a procession of phantasms emerge in\\r\\nsingle file through the illuminated screen.  As if suspended on a\\r\\nclothesline, they weave and bounce along the length of the pulsating beam,\\r\\nand pass through the hole in the projection booth.  The apparition is\\r\\ngone. All is quiet.  Then the audience bursts into wildly enthusiastic\\r\\napplause.\\r\\n\\r\\nINT.

This time they\\'ve gone too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cop looks at Peck like he\\'s insane, then sees the Stay-Puft Man\\r\\nlooming up at the end of the block.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCOP\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(knocking Peck\\'s hands\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taway)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tYou arrest them, numb nuts!  I\\'m getting out\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tof here.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe runs off.  Peck turns to face the monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STAY PUFT MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground shakes with every step as he reaches the building. Then, using\\r\\nthe church next door as a stepping stone, he begins climbing the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\\r\\n\\r\\nThey look over the edge of the roof as the Marshmallow Man climbs higher\\r\\nand higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(shouts)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tHit him!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey each fire point blank at the Stay-Puft Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bellows with pain and rage as the beams strike him right in the chest\\r\\nand set his skin on fire.  He begins to burn with a blue flame that\\r\\nspreads quickly across his torso and down his arms.  The Stay-Puft Man\\r\\nbellows even louder, flailing its huge arms in response to the searing\\r\\nflames that are starting to engulf him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stare at the horrible conflagration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWINSTON\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tGood.  Now we made him mad.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nCarbonous, flaming hunks of melting marshmallow are flying from his arms\\r\\nas he waves them in wild rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STREET\\r\\n\\r\\nPeck stands there paralyzed with fear.  A mass of flaming marshmallow\\r\\nfalls and flattens a news stand nearby.  Then a huge glob of sticky\\r\\ntoasted marshmallow comes zipping down from above and lands right on him,\\r\\nburying him up to his neck in melted sucrose.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flaming monster keeps coming intent on their destruction.  Most of his\\r\\nchest has melted away revealing horrid musculature and a skeletal rib\\r\\ncage.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\\r\\n\\r\\nThey square off and face him for the last time, their weapons poised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(calmly)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tWe\\'re going to be killed by a hundred-foot\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tmarshmallow.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is almost on them now, fully engulfed in flames, reaching for them,\\r\\nready to swat them with his burning fist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(to the others)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tOn the count of three!

The entire front of the temple is obliterated along with the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STAY-PUFT MAN\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the destruction of his earthly portal, the flaming monster is\\r\\nsuddenly engulfed in a cyclonic wind that begins to swirl around him like\\r\\na fire-storm.  The flames are whipped higher and higher as the tornado\\r\\nbegins to pick up rotational speed. Then the Marshmallow Man seems to\\r\\nexplode from deep inside creating a flaming air burst high above the\\r\\nrooftops.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ROOFTOP\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ghostbusters are blasted off their feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SKY\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fireball reaches its maximum explosive force, then a sudden jet of air\\r\\npressure occurs like a titanic vacuum cleaner in the sky and sucks the\\r\\nflaming mass of gasses and ash up through our atmosphere and right out of\\r\\nour dimension.  The dark clouds disappear with it, leaving a beautiful\\r\\nclear blue sky over the whole area.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TEMPLE\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now looks like an ancient ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are lying at the foot of the stairs. Everything is still.  One by one\\r\\nthey get slowly to their feet and look around to see that the crisis has\\r\\npassed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSTANTZ\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tEverybody okay?\\r\\n\\r\\nVenkman looks up at the portal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TERROR DOGS\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are still on the pedestals but charred almost beyond recognition.\\r\\nVenkman mounts the stairs and gazes sadly at the remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PEDESTAL\\r\\n\\r\\nVenkman stands there mourning, then a slight movement under the blackened\\r\\nskin of the Terror Dog catches his eye.  The movement gets stronger, then\\r\\nsuddenly a human hand pokes through the carbonous coating.\\r\\n\\r\\nVENKMAN\\r\\n\\r\\nHope surges in him and he starts frantically tearing away the black\\r\\ncoating, finally revealing Dana alive and well under the burnt skin of the\\r\\nTerror Dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTANTZ AND SPENGLER\\r\\n\\r\\nThey peel the charred coating off Louis and help him to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOUIS\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looks around wondering how he ended up on the roof of a wrecked\\r\\nhigh-rise. He looks at his scorched and ripped suit crusted with the\\r\\nstill-smoking gobs of melted marshmallow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLOUIS\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(amazed)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tJeez!  Somebody must have spiked the egg\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tsalad.\\r\\n\\r\\nVENKMAN\\r\\n\\r\\nHe helps Dana to her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVENKMAN\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you all right?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looks around at the incredible scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDANA\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(totally confused)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tOh, sure.
