    "# Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are old technology. The most famous classic chatbot is [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), a system developed in the 1960s that answered questions based on templates. There are a few implementations of ELIZA out there, and you can test a version by [Kenneth Ronkowitz](https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "ELIZA was built to mimick a particular type of therapist: someone who asks you further questions about what you are saying. The answers where like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: Your boyfriend made you come here</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: He says I'm depressed much of the time.</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: I am sorry to hear you are depressed</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: It's true. I am unhappy.</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: I need some help, that much seems certain</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: What would it mean to you if you got some help</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is from Weizenbaum, J. (1966). [ELIZAâ€”a computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365153.365168). _Communications of the ACM_, 9(1), 36-45.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that you can create the answers by using pattern matching, introducing things like \"I am sorry you are X\", when X is in a pre-defined list of negative mental states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, chatbots range from speech-to-speech systems like Siri, Alexa, Cortana and the like, to text-based chatbots that you may find on your bank's website. Full conversational systems like Siri need to incorporate speech processing, language understanding, plus a way of getting answers to you (usually by searching the web). Customer service chatbots just need a language model to understand and generate language, plus a database that contains company information that the customer may need. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also build a chatbot that [retrieves answers from a corpus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZOzKQPSrDo), or one based on generative AI, which [generates answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB3dOuV6f4s) by encoding your question. "

    "## Pattern-matching chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build a simple chatbot by storing a series of potential questions and answers. That is, \"if the user says X, then answer Y\". We are going to try that here. We will use spaCy's [Matcher](https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching) module to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "This particular implementation is based on [Ahilya's](https://heartbeat.comet.ml/chatbot-development-using-spacy-4f6515cb17b8). It produces an extremely simple dialogue; just a greeting and only in response to \"hello\". You can extend it with other patterns. "
