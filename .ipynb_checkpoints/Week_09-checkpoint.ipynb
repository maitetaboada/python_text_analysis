    "# Sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a computational method to extract 'sentiment' from text. What 'sentiment' means varies, but in general, it is the positive or negative opinion about something that is conveyed in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic methods have a dictionary of positive and negative words and then check to see how many of those are in the text in question. You can do fancy calculations, but a difference or relative proportion is common. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is used widely, from online posts and reviews to survey data and news. There are many issues with using it without fully understanding what the numbers mean. Do check the reading on Canvas to explore more about it: \n",

    "# Sentiment analysis with VADER\n",
    "\n",
    "[VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) is a lexicon-based system for sentiment analysis. It takes a text (or post, headline, etc.) and provides two scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Proportion of the text with positive, negative, or neutral words\n",
    "  * This just counts the words in the text that are also in the [dictionary](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt) and calculates the ratio\n",
    "* Composite score\n",
    "  * Calculated using the [dictionary](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt), plus applying a set of rules to deal with negation and other linguistic phenomena that may change the score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an implementation of VADER in NLTK, so we will use that version."
