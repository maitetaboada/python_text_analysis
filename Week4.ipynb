    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using functions already but we never really went in depth on what they are. A function is really just a way to do some computation and receive a result from that computation. To do this the function needs an input that we provide to it. So the three parts of any function is input, computation, and output. Take for example the `open()` function. We pass it a path to a file and it returns us an opened file. We don't get to see the computation since it is hidden and we don't ask for a print output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with many predefined functions. However, sometimes we need to create our own functions so that we can easily reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a user-defined function we start by defining the function name and input what it takes using `def`. Then we put our code after the defining line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the colon and new line. The contents of the function are always indented below the colon. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also optionally include a statement outlining what the function does. This is like a comment, except it has a slightly different format. Note the 3 quotation marks and that the text appears in a different colour. This is an instruction to python to store that information as special information. You can then retrieve that information with a `help(function_name)` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want our function to return some answer or result then we need to include a `return` commmand at the end of our function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next code block I will create a function for computing lexical diversity. To review how functions work here is a good tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp"
