    "# Topic modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling is a very useful technique to get information from a large dataset. It is a type of *unsupervised machine learning*. Recall that *supervised machine learning* involved learning patterns from data, given a dataset and labels (e.g., movie reviews and stars). In unsupervised machine learning, we find patterns, but we do not have labels associated with the data. The task is to learn to classify or cluster the data by exploiting the patterns or similarities in the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind topic modelling is that you can identify topics or themes in a collection of documents using words that co-occur. One of the implementations of this idea is LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which assumes a distribution that we try to find using words in the text. The figure below is from an easy to follow paper outlining LDA. \n",

    "\n",
    "The data for topic modelling needs to be normalized following the usual steps we have done so far: tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal. Then, we use a topic modelling module to find the topics in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation here is based on a project on extracting topics from news articles, [TACT](https://github.com/sfu-discourse-lab/TACT/tree/master). \n",

    "If you want to see topic models in action, go to the [research site](https://gendergaptracker.research.sfu.ca/apps/topicmodel) for the Gender Gap Tracker and check topics for any month in the last 8 years. Those are the main topics covered in Canadian news. "

    "We will work with a collection of news articles, a part of the [SFU Opinion and Comments Corpus (SOCC)](https://github.com/sfu-discourse-lab/SOCC). The corpus was collected in our lab, the Discourse Processing Lab, for a project on evaluative language in online news comments. It consists of: opinion articles, comments, and annotated comments from the Canadian newspaper _The Globe and Mail_. We'll work with the articles, which should be in the data directory. If not, you can always download the corpus directly from the page above or from its [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mtaboada/sfu-opinion-and-comments-corpus-socc) and save the `gnm_articles.csv` file to your data directory."
