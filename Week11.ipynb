    "# Authorship attribution and style analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very general area of study that can help you figure out who wrote what, but also the differences among authors. Authorship attribution is quite popular in literature, for instance, determining if an anonymous piece of fiction was written by a famous author, based on that author's published work. That's, in part, how it was discovered that ['The Cuckoo's Calling', by one Robert Galbraith, was, in fact, the work of J.K. Rowling](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-a-computer-program-helped-show-jk-rowling-write-a-cuckoos-calling/). Authorship attribution is one of the subfields within [forensic linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_linguistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the method can be applied to investigate the style of a text, to figure out how complex it is, or what other characteristics it has, a field known as [stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry). \n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out the characteristics of text, and, more importantly, to distinguish the style of different authors, we can use different measures. Among the most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Word length\n",
    "  * Average frequency, or frequency distribution. This may distinguish authors that like long words. In English, this usually means words of Latinate origin. So this tells us something about the vocabulary of an author. \n",
    "* Most common words\n",
    "  * Some authors just like to use the same set of words often. This one is a bit tricky, because most common words may also have to do with the topic of the text, not with the author.\n",
    "* Function words\n",
    "  * Function words, or stopwords, are sometimes idiosynchratic. Some authors love to use _nonetheless_. Others prefer _nevertheless_. Some authors use a lot of _so_; others _but_ or _if_\n",
    "  * Related, sometimes punctuation is an interesting marker of style. Do you use semi-colons often? Most people don't, but if you do, it's a tell.\n",
    "* Parts of speech\n",
    "  * Relative use of nouns, verbs, adverbs, etc. [Adverbs](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/i8wjh4uNOfjbcZNuVvMPQM/The-adverbs-that-gave-JK-Rowling-away.html) were one of the characteristics of J.K. Rowling's style that tied her to Robert Galbraith.\n",
    "* Statistical similarity\n",
    "  * Various methods of statististical similarity across texts. "

    "We will compare three things in three different books:\n",

    "* [The War of the Worlds](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26291), by H.G. Wells, science fiction\n",
    "* [The Lost World](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139), also by Arthur Conan Doyle, science fiction\n",
