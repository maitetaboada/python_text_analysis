    "# Pandas and dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a python library to work with and store data in a spreadsheet-like format. Pandas allows us to store big datasets of numbers such as type and token counts of hundreds of texts. This notebook introduces some of the basic concepts and functions from Pandas that we'll need, but there are also great introductions out there:\n",

    "We will work with two basic Pandas data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Series\n",
    "* Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "A series is very similar to a list or a dictionary. For instance, we have seen lists of words (tokens) extracted from a document and dictionaries of words and their frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* List: `['If', 'you', 'use', '``', 'bad', \"''\", 'to', 'mean', '``', 'good', \"''\", ',', 'then', ...]`\n",
    "* Dictionary: `{',': 31, 'the': 24, '.': 21, 'a': 14, 'and': 14, 'to': 13, \"'s\": 6, 'The': 6, 'I': 6, 'is': 5, ...}`\n",
    "\n",
    "In a series, you'll get that dictionary as a vertical list: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ",     31\n",
    "the   24\n",
    ".     21\n",
    "a     14\n",
    "and   14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, with Pandas, you can turn those series into dataframes. Dataframes are like spreadsheets. So, from the dictionary above, we can create a dataframe that looks sort of like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Token       | Count    |\n",
    "| ----------- | -------- |\n",
    "| ,           | 31       |\n",
    "| the         | 24       |\n",
    "| .           | 21       |\n",
    "| a           | 14       |\n",
    "| and         | 14       |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first start with the same process we've done before, where we had files and their token, type, sentence, and lexical diversity count. We'll convert those lists and dictionaries into series and then put them into a dataframe. Finally, and to save the information, we'll use a Pandas function to save that dataframe into a csv file. A comma-separated value file is an easy way to store table information in a text-only format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing all the packages we need. Note that we import Pandas as \"pd\". That allows us to type the Pandas functions with a shorthand, \"pd\", rather than the full \"pandas\". "
