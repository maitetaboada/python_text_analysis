    "\n",
    "Most data you'll encounter contains extremely useful information and information that you don't really need or that is actually noise. Cleaning and preprocessing allows you keep the useful information. It also puts the data in formats that will be easy to process by python and other programs.\n",

    "### File Processing\n",
    "\n",

    "Opening a file using the `with open() as` will store the opened file in a data type that we can then use to read the file contents and store the contents to a variable. I will demonstrate how to open a file and save the contents to a string variable. The `open()` function takes two inputs: first the name of the file, and second whether you want to read(\"r\") or write(\"w\") to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's create our own text file in the data folder. You should have a folder called 'data' from last week, which contains the Ghostbusters script. Go to that directory, and create your own text file there. Using notepad create a file with some text in it and save it inside the data folder. I've done this and called my file 'sample.txt'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the 'data' folder, navigate to the directory where this notebook sits (remember you can use `pwd` to find it) and create a new directory, called 'data'. Then, create a text file inside called \"sample.txt\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Most text, however, has more advanced information. This includes things like curly brackets and apostrophes (instead of straight quotes), but also accents, umlauts, emoji and many other special characters that plain text cannot handle. Then you need to use other forms of **encoding,** ways to store information that goes beyond the simple character. Character encoding maps characters to numerical representations. \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, the pizza slice emoji 🍕 has the Unicode \"code\" `U+1F355`, whereas the corresponding code for a whitespace is `U+0020`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings, such as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), which is defined by the Unicode standard. If you don't know the encoding of your text, it is a good bet that it is in UTF-8. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't think that Unicode is only for foreign accents or emoji. Even in plain English, whenever you change from straight quotes to curly quotes (aka smart quotes), you are using Unicode. Note the difference in the quotes and the apostrophe in the two sentences below.\n",
